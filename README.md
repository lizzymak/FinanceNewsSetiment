## 🔎 What is FinanceNewsSentiment

FinanceNewsSentiment is designed to help users quickly gauge public sentiment about a company by analyzing current news headlines. Instead of reading dozens of articles, users can simply input a company name and get an automated sentiment score that helps them decide whether public reaction is broadly positive, negative, or neutral.  

This is useful for:  
- Investors or stock-market enthusiasts monitoring company sentiment  
- Students or researchers analyzing public perception of companies over time  
- Anyone interested in combining NLP (natural language processing) with real-time data visualization
